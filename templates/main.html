<h1>Sammify</h1>
<p>Remember the web of 1996 when images were no more than 200 pixels wide and they
took forever to load? Did it make you feel good? I know you want to feel like that again!</p>
<p>Inspired by magic create by Sam Wierema here you can upload a picture and it will
show like a picture in 1996. Have fun!</p>
